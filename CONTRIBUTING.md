# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the project. ♥️

Please follow the instructions below:

## ISSUES 🐛

When you're creating a new issue make sure to share as much information as you can. This helps to better understand the issue and fix/add new features quickly.

- Open an issue if you found a bug.
- If you want me to add any missing feature, please open an issue.

## GitHub Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository using the command.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/fur-miliar.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch. If you're fixing a bug start the branch name with `fix/` **OR** if you're adding a new feature start the branch name with `feature/`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b (fix|feature)/<WHAT-YOU-FIXED>
   ```

4. Make changes. Commit the changes with a relevant commit message.

   ```bash
   git add . // or file name
   git commit -m '<WHAT-WAS-THE-CHANGE>'
   ```

5. Push the changes to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request.

Thanks! 😁
